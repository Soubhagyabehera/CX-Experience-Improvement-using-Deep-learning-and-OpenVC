# CX-Experience-Improvement-using-Deep-learning-and-OpenVC

Customer experience improvement factors generally are:
● Vision,Customer Behaviour
● Customer value proposition,operation
● Organisation,Technology

● We basically focus on Vision,Customer Behaviour for it is gives the most obvious reaction of any consumer about any product or brand and finding out the unique sale point ,areas of expansion or enhancement
● Gender is also one of the most important factor as the customer's buying point differs from gender to gender.
● Rethinking the entire customer journey & experience i.e, reflecting new needs and presenting actionable plans.
● Presenting meaningful transformation for digital customer lifecycle.

Basically here i am detecting the emotion and gender using deep learing .
Also using harracascade_eye.xml cascade to detect the eyeball movement.

To run the project you have to install the required dependencies and then python3 emotion.py

It is giving accuracy of 90%-93%.
